In particular, the underlying protocols may be subject to sudden changes in operating rules (including &ldquo;forks&rdquo;). Any such material operating changes may materially affect the availability, value, functionality, and/or the name of the Digital Currency you store in your Digital Currency Wallet. EdenLedger does not control the timing and features of these material operating changes. It is your responsibility to make yourself aware of upcoming operating changes and you must carefully consider publicly available information and information that may be provided by EdenLedger in determining whether to continue to use a EdenLedger Account for the affected Digital Currency.

If your payment is not successful, if your payment method has insufficient funds, or if you reverse a payment made from funds in your bank account, you authorize EdenLedger, in its sole discretion, either to cancel the transaction or to debit your other payment methods, including your Digital Currency Wallet balances or other linked accounts, in any amount necessary to complete the transaction. You are responsible for maintaining an adequate balance and/or sufficient credit limits in order to avoid overdraft, non-sufficient funds (NSF), or similar fees charged by your payment provider. We reserve the right to refuse to process, or to cancel or reverse, any Digital Currency Transaction or Transfers in our sole discretion, even after funds have been debited from your account(s), if we suspect the transaction involves (or has a high risk of involvement in) money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, or any other type of financial crime; in response to a subpoena, court order, or other government order; if we reasonably suspect that the transaction is erroneous; or if EdenLedger suspects the transaction relates to Prohibited Use or a Prohibited Business as set forth below. In such instances, EdenLedger will reverse the transaction and we are under no obligation to allow you to reinstate a purchase or sale order at the same price or on the same terms as the cancelled transaction.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Digital Currency Transfers:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If you have sufficiently verified your identity, your Digital Currency Wallet enables you to send Supported Digital Currency to, and request, receive, and store Supported Digital Currency from, third parties by giving instructions through the EdenLedger Site. Your transfer of Supported Digital Currencies between your other digital currency wallets (including wallets off the EdenLedger Site) and to and from third parties is a &ldquo;Digital Currency Transfer&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Once a Digital Currency Transfer is submitted to a Digital Currency network, the transaction will be unconfirmed and remain in a pending state for a period of time sufficient to confirmation of the transaction by the Digital Currency network. A Digital Currency Transfer is not complete while it is in a pending state. Pending Digital Currency Transfers that are initiated from a EdenLedger Account will reflect a pending transaction status and are not available to you for use on the EdenLedger platform or otherwise while the transaction is pending.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6 c4">Inbound transfers:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">When you or a third party sends Digital Currency to an EdenLedger wallet from an external wallet not hosted on EdenLedger (&ldquo;Inbound Transfers&rdquo;), the person initiating the transaction is solely responsible for executing the transaction properly, which may include, among other things, payment of sufficient network or miner&rsquo;s fees in order for the transaction to be successful. Insufficient network fees may cause an Inbound Transfer to remain in a pending state outside of EdenLedger&rsquo;s control and we are not responsible for delays or loss incurred as a result of an error in the initiation of the transaction and have no obligation to assist in the remediation of such transactions. By initiating an Inbound Transfer, you attest that you are transacting in a Supported Digital Currency which conforms to the particular EdenLedger wallet into which funds are directed. For example, if you select an Ethereum wallet address to receive funds, you attest that you are initiating an Inbound Transfer of Ethereum alone, and not any other currency such as Bitcoin or Ethereum Classic. EdenLedger incurs no obligation whatsoever with regard to unsupported digital currency sent to a EdenLedger Account or Supported Digital Currency sent to an incompatible Digital Currency wallet. Erroneously transmitted funds will be lost. We recommend customers send a small amount of Supported Digital Currency as a test prior to initiating a send of a significant amount of Supported Digital Currency. EdenLedger may from time to time determine types of Digital Currency that will be supported or cease to be supported.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6 c4">Outbound transfers:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">When you send Digital Currency from your EdenLedger Account to an external wallet (&ldquo;Outbound Transfers&rdquo;), such transfers are executed at your instruction by EdenLedger. You should verify all transaction information prior to submitting instructions to us. EdenLedger shall bear no liability or responsibility in the event you enter an incorrect blockchain destination address. We do not guarantee the identity or value received by a recipient of an Outbound Transfer. Digital Currency Transfers cannot be reversed once they have been broadcast to the relevant Digital Currency network, although they may be in a pending state, and designated accordingly, while the transaction is processed by network operators. EdenLedger does not control the Digital Currency network and makes no guarantees that a Digital Currency Transfer will be confirmed by the network. We may refuse to process or cancel any pending Outbound Digital Currency Transfers as required by law or any court or other authority to which EdenLedger is subject in any jurisdiction. Additionally, we may require you to wait some amount of time after completion of a transaction before permitting you to use further EdenLedger Services and/or before permitting you to engage in transactions beyond certain volume limits.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6 c4">Third party merchants: </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">We have no control over, or liability for, the delivery, quality, safety, legality or any other aspect of any goods or services that you may purchase from a third party (including other users of EdenLedger Digital Currency Services). We are not responsible for ensuring that a third party buyer or a seller you transact with will complete the transaction or is authorised to do so.
